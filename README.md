Assignment 5: Fortran 77 - Array Sort and Search <br />

## Program Details

I had a hard time figuring out how things worked in fortran, especially how to <br />
define an array and iterate over it. I found out that we had to use labels, which reminded <br />
me of using Assembly. Because of this unfond memory of using Assembly, I was turned off quite <br />
a bit. Nonetheless, I managed to complete the assignment with the help of that reference guide,<br />
although it was difficult to understand how it worked at first (and admittedly still is a bit confusing).
